## show table columns: 
- SHOW COLUMNS FROM <table_name>;
- DESC <table_name> => describe;
the third column is Null COLUMN
if column's values are yes, it means if you try to insert a row 
with missing any column value, it will be null.

## see data of a table: 
- SELECT * FROM <table_name>;

## show table warnings after any crud operation;
- SHOW WARNINGS;
if we try to insert a string more than max varchar chars, we will recieve a warning, but you will see row affected. for example in this case, the rest of the string will be gone. another example is to insert string into an int column which become 0.
after you see the data of warnings, the warnings will be gone.

## Create table with not null and default column:
- CREATE TABLE <table_name>(<column_1_name> <data_type> NOT NULL, <column_2_name> <data_type> <default_value>, <column_3_name> <data_type> NOT NULL <default_value>);

if try to insert null values into a non-null column, it will try to use the default value and if default value is NULL, then it will assign zero value of that type into the missing column.

as a side note, you can store NULL value directly into a column but focus that if you try to dirrectly assign a NULL value into a non-null column, you will get an error and it's not permitted.
