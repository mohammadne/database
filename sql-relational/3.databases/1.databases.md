actually we have our my-sql database server that's
running on our local machine (mysql-ctl start)

a server can contain multiple datatbases for different
applications, which are independent

## show all databases your mySQL server: 
- SHOW DATABASES;
- \l

## creating databases: 
- CREATE DATABASE <db_name>;

recommandation: use all lower-case with underscore chars for names
you don't have to use uppercase characters in sql-commands
but it's a good practice for SQL

## delete database: 
- DROP DATABASE <db_name>;

## use database: 
- USE <db_name>;
- \c <db_name>;
because for ex, you want to search in a database

## show the database we are using currently: 
- SELECT DATABASE();
- select current_database();
if you don't selected a DB, it will show you null for selected DB.

### what NULL means ?
it says the value is not known(not mean zero!!!).
