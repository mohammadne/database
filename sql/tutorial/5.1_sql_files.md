### run sql files
source <file_name>.sql

remember that you shoud select a database before sourcing

writing multi-line commands on cli is a little cumbersome
for example if you have a typo in above lines, there's no
way to correct it. so it's better to run SQL from files.
you can have CREATE, INSERT and ... on a single file.

from now on, we will enter our commands into sql files instead of cli
