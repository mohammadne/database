-- in our case the right join is exactly the same as inner join
-- because we don't have any orders that don't have customer
-- if we could be wrong and delete some users, then some orders have no any customers
-- then the customer of orders in right join will be null
-- but in inner join we don't have them but becasue of foreign key constraints
-- it's not possible, so  drop tables and recreate them without foreign key.

-- focus: left join == (right join + alter the place of join sets)
